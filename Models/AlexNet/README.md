# AlexNet

### Description

ResNet is a classic network structure or backbone to extract the features of a image, in order to classify the image or do further operations. Here this network was written in the framework PaddlePaddle(dygraph mode), which is so similar with Pytorch, but is easy to deploy the Model.

### Detail

The code may be not good, and not be simplified

This dir contains also some code to preprocess the image
