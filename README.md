# PaddleLearning

### Description

This repository contains the scripts during my learning of machine learning and its application.
The scripts are mainly written in [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) - a framework which enables people to program the network and implement the machine learing Algorithm easily

Also, some other libraries such as numpy, PIL or skimage are also used.

*This repository will be updated with the deepening of my learning*
