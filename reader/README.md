# Reader or Data Pre-handler

This dir contains some scripts,which can 

* divide a image set into a training set and a evaluation set, with a train_list.txt, a label_list.txt and a eval_list.txt generated
* randomly exhance the image or process the image using other operations
....

With the deepening of my learning more script and features will be added into the list

*forgive my poor English :)*
